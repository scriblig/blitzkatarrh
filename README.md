Future war. We were brought up on it - whether it be 2000AD or Larry
Niven, future war has given writers the opportunity to construct
far-out artifact scenarios and readers an easy road to suspension of
disbelief : war is madness after all, is it not? This is a short piece
on future war, unfortunately manhandling a series of well-worn and
existing tropes. I'm sure I had something of the Starship Troopers in
the back of the noggin here, but with a couple of tweaks. It works out
a little pulpy, but I do like some of the language. In any case, this
little piece has had its two alloted form rejections, from [Strange
Horizons](http://www.strangehorizons.com/) and [Kasma
Magazine](http://www.kasmamagazine.com/), so here it is in Creative
Commons.

Have all future war stories been done? Or have they been refined to
the absurd? (Witness the millisecond-spanning engagements of the Ships
in Iain M. Banks? Culture universe, especially
[Excession](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excession). What next for
future war?
